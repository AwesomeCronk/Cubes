# Cubes
This project is an implementation of te Marching Cubes algorithm, inspired by Sebastian Lague's Coding Adventure on Marching Cubes. Sebastian's techniques were used heavily in this project, with some exceptions being that I wrote my own lookup table and used Python 3 with PyQt5 instead of C# with Unity. This project will become a fully functioning screensaver by the time it is done.
