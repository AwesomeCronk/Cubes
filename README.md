# Cubes
This project is an implementation of te Marching Cubes algorithm, inspired by Sebastion Lague's Coding Adventure on Marching Cubes. Sebastion's techniques were used heavily in this project, with the exception that I wrote my own lookup table. This project will become a fully functioning screensaver by the time it is done.
